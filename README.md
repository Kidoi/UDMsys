## Introduction
âœ¨As unmanned device technology gradually matures, more and more unmanned devices are being used in a variety of application scenarios. When the number of unmanned devices put into actual use in existing systems increases immeasurably, the existing systems are far from being able to meet the current needs of unmanned device management.

ðŸŒˆTherefore, based on an in-depth investigation and analysis of the development status and application scenarios of unmanned equipment, this topic mainly focuses on the management of unmanned equipment and the analysis and processing of unmanned equipment data, aiming to develop a system driven by cloud-edge collaboration. An unmanned equipment management system platform capable of supporting the display, management and analysis of massive equipment information data.
